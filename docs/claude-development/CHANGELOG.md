# Development Changelog

## Mobile Navigation & Theme Switcher Enhancement (August 7, 2025)

### Mobile Navigation Improvements
- **Smaller Mobile Navigation**: Significantly reduced mobile floating navigation size for better screen real estate
- **Compact Design**: Optimized button spacing, padding, progress bar height, and typography
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Reduced container margins and improved touch target optimization

### Mobile Keyboard Viewport Fix
- **Safe Area Support**: Applied `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` and `constant(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for iOS compatibility
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Navigation adapts to mobile keyboard display/hide changes automatically
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Support for both legacy iOS 11.0 and modern browser standards
- **CSS Utilities**: Added reusable viewport-aware CSS classes for future use

### Theme Switcher Architecture Refactor
- **Mobile Theme Access**: Repositioned theme switcher next to mobile menu button in navbar
- **Component Extraction**: Created reusable `ThemeSwitcherButton` component eliminating ~200 lines of duplicate code
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `ThemeSwitcher.jsx` component
- **Clean Architecture**: Single source of truth with flexible props system (`isMobile`, `layoutId`, `buttonSize`)

### Technical Implementation
# Development Changelog

## pnpm Migration & Dependency Fix (September 12, 2025)

### Project Tooling Update
- **Migration to pnpm**: Switched from npm to pnpm for dependency management to leverage its performance and efficiency.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved a critical startup error (`Failed to resolve import "prop-types"`) caused by pnpm's stricter handling of dependencies. The `prop-types` package was added as an explicit dependency.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Ensured `pnpm-lock.yaml` is tracked in version control to guarantee consistent dependency installation across all environments.

### Documentation Enhancements
- **README Update**: Updated the `README.md` to provide clear instructions for developers using either `pnpm` or `npm`.
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Added `pnpm` commands to the "Getting Started", "Development Server", "Production Build", and "Scripts" sections for consistency.

## Auto-scroll Fix: Chatbot Iframe Focus Issue (August 6, 2025)

### Critical Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Website automatically scrolled to AI Assistant section on first page load
- **Root Cause**: Hugging Face chatbot iframe attempting to autofocus textarea input during load
- **Console Errors**: `svelte.js:672 Blocked autofocusing on a <textarea> element in a cross-origin subframe`

### Solution Implemented: Lazy Loading Pattern
- **Lazy Iframe Loading**: Iframe only loads after explicit user interaction
- **"Start Chatting" Button**: Beautiful overlay button that users must click to activate chatbot
- **Fallback UI Enhancement**: Career information displayed immediately while chatbot awaits activation
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduces initial page load by deferring iframe loading

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// CareerChatbot.jsx - Lazy loading state management
const [shouldLoadIframe, setShouldLoadIframe] = useState(false);

// Conditional rendering: fallback UI first, iframe after user interaction
if (!shouldLoadIframe) {
  return <FallbackUIWithStartButton onClick={() => setShouldLoadIframe(true)} />;
}
return <IframeComponent />;
```

### User Experience Benefits
- ✅ **Hero Section Always Visible**: Page consistently loads at top as intended
- ✅ **No Console Errors**: Eliminates cross-origin autofocus warnings
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Faster initial page load without iframe overhead
- ✅ **Enhanced Control**: Users explicitly choose when to activate chatbot
- ✅ **Maintained Functionality**: Full chatbot features available after activation

### Verification Results
- ✅ Page loads at Hero section consistently across all devices
- ✅ No unwanted scrolling behavior on first visit
- ✅ Console errors eliminated completely
- ✅ Chatbot functionality preserved and enhanced
- ✅ Theme integration maintained across all variants

## Project System Revolution (January 2025)

### Problem Analysis & Solution
**User Feedback**: "messy interaction of flipping and hover, and Backface design" in ProjectCard, "not very happy with its design" for ProjectModal

### ProjectCard.jsx - Complete Redesign
**Issue**: 3D flip animations causing hover/interaction conflicts, poor accessibility
**Solution**: Revolutionary clean design approach
- ❌ **Eliminated**: Complex 3D rotateY transforms and flip animations
- ✅ **Implemented**: Clean hover effects (lift -8px + scale 1.02)
- ✅ **Added**: Tech stack previews with expandable modal
- ✅ **Enhanced**: 4-theme support with consistent styling

```javascript
const hoverVariants = {
  rest: { y: 0, scale: 1, transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" } },
  hover: { y: -8, scale: 1.02, transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" } }
};
```

### ProjectModal.jsx - Mobile-First Excellence
**Issue**: Poor mobile experience with desktop-oriented fixed layouts
**Solution**: Revolutionary responsive design with adaptive architecture
- ✅ **Mobile-First**: Responsive sizing `max-w-sm sm:max-w-lg md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-4xl`
- ✅ **Tabbed Interface**: Overview/Features/Tech Stack/Live Preview
- ✅ **Adaptive Layouts**: Stackable mobile, scrollable tabs, responsive text
- ✅ **Touch Optimization**: 44px minimum tap targets, gesture handling

```javascript
className={`relative rounded-xl sm:rounded-2xl border shadow-2xl 
  w-full max-w-sm sm:max-w-lg md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-4xl 
  max-h-[95vh] sm:max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col overflow-hidden`}
```

### LiveDemoPreview.jsx - Adaptive Innovation
**Issue**: Desktop-only controls providing poor mobile experience
**Innovation**: Different control systems per device type
- **Desktop**: Floating overlay controls (compact, efficient)
- **Mobile**: Full-width control panel (touch-optimized)
- **Technical**: Real-time responsive detection with resize listeners

```javascript
const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const checkMobile = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
  checkMobile();
  window.addEventListener("resize", checkMobile);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", checkMobile);
}, []);
```

### Performance Optimization Results
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: ProjectModal from 67.69 kB to 33.38 kB
- **Code Splitting**: Strategic lazy loading implementation
- **Architecture**: Clean component separation with proper state management
- **Accessibility**: Maintained perfect WCAG AA compliance throughout

### Mobile Optimization
**User Feedback**: "we can do better in mobile devices, make it size more friendly"
**Resolution**: User solved mobile layout issues during Claude usage break
**Analysis**: Components now feature adaptive control systems and responsive design patterns

### Integration Success
**LiveDemoPreview Integration**: Successfully integrated as 4th tab in ProjectModal
**Result**: Seamless user experience with adaptive controls per device type
