  summary: `Hi, I’m Yuelin — a full stack developer who thrives in ambiguity and enjoys turning messy, undefined problems into clear, scalable systems.
            At ByteCronix, I’ve led the delivery of real-world SaaS features for an AI-powered PR platform, building dockerised microservices, secure auth, and scalable APIs using Clean Architecture and BFF principles. I also improved team velocity through CI/CD pipelines and technical documentation.
            I care deeply about performance, clarity, and developer empathy — from backend logic to frontend polish.
            Let’s build something meaningful.`,
